\r\n\r\nOur current scarecrow testing framework supports both feature tests and regular tests.

Having thought through the use case a bit, i don't think there's a time you're ever interested in both feature failures and regular failures, so i'd like to differentiate them a bit more

We want to cut this down as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThere are probably two main approaches we can take.  The first is to make a superset of all view fields and summarize them all at once.  Then the summarized values could be copied into separate summary objects for each view (there's some poc code for this in https://github.com/Factual/scarecrow/commit/64208036c8af55069b1c0a202693f948d6d8811d).  The other approach is to define core and extended views and summarize them like we currently do.  After summarization, we would copy the core fields into all the extended views and potentially run some extra post processors relevant to the extended view.\r\n\r\nAt one point, there was a discussion about using only one real view per dataset and treating extended attributes as logical views.  This would give us the summarization speedup automatically and reduce the number of indexes we build.  I think I remember @bfs mentioning that this might cause problems with federation, but I don't know what the exact issue was.

We want to cut this down as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThere are probably two main approaches we can take.  The first is to make a superset of all view fields and summarize them all at once.  Then the summarized values could be copied into separate summary objects for each view (there's some poc code for this in https://github.com/Factual/scarecrow/commit/64208036c8af55069b1c0a202693f948d6d8811d).  The other approach is to define core and extended views and summarize them like we currently do.  After summarization, we would copy the core fields into all the extended views and potentially run some extra post processors relevant to the extended view.\r\n\r\nAt one point, there was a discussion about using only one real view per dataset and treating extended attributes as logical views.  This would give us the summarization speedup automatically and reduce the number of indexes we build.  I think I remember @bfs mentioning that this might cause problems with federation, but I don't know what the exact issue was.

In effect, this \"triple-sourcing\" will (most likely) give the cluster enough confidence to pass into Stable -- even though all the inputs originated from Foursquare.\r\n\r\nHere's a real-life example: http://stitch.corp.factual.com/input/txIgmU/935b8beb-c28e-4f6c-af74-c9d2167c1b7f?viewId=Iw1HPj\r\n\r\nMy question is: should we consider inputs from the same sourceUrl domain the same, irrespective of their other partnerId/sourceId/userId fields?\r\n\r\nI ask because I spent most of yesterday rewriting inputs so we'd have fewer examples like the above, where multiple inputs from the same sourceUrl cause a summary to export. If we consider inputs A, B, and C to be the same, it'll remove a fair amount of junk/dupes from the U.S.\r\n\r\ndoes that make sense? i might be missing a big reason why we treat the three inputs above as unique...\r\nwould like to assign to @justin-factual but don't have write perms."}],"commits":[],"id":"bcoppersmith"}
